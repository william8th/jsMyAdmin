# jsMyAdmin
jsMyAdmin is a simple and fast MySQL administration tool written fully using Javascript tools (frontend and backend).

## Introduction
As the project's name suggests, jsMyAdmin aims to function similar to the popular MySQL web-based administration tool 'phpMyAdmin' but built on Javascript instead of PHP. The main advantage that this project seeks to bring is a quick and snappy single-page MySQL administration application compared to the slow and sluggish phpMyAdmin. __Note that this tool is not a replacement for the well-supported legacy phpMyAdmin.__

## Version
